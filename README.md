## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

The challenging part of the project for me was handling active elements on the DOM with CSS. At first I thought of different quirky ways to handle rating clicks, but soon realized with the power of React, this can be relatively simple to achieve. As you can see from my button below:

```
<button
  id={'1'}
  className={isActive === '1' ? 'active' : undefined}
  onClick={handleRating}>1
</button>
```

This uses a ternary operator to assign an 'active' className to my button. And from my rating method:

```
handleRating = (e) => {
  const value = e.target.innerText;
  this.setState({ rating: value });
  this.setState({ isActive: e.target.id });
}
```

You can see that by clicking the rating button this sets the 'isActive' state to the target ID from my button.
By doing this, the ID keeps track of which element is currently clicked and setting that element to 'active'.

Then the CSS is applied:

```
.active {
  background-color: var(--light-grey);
  color: var(--white);
}
```

If you're working on this challenge and need clarification. Let me know!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
